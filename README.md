# Factors affecting income inequality project

The project explores the role of different factors in income inequality, as measured
by the Gini coefficient. Data collected for over 140 countries. Four regression
models were created to show the probable connection between various factors
in economic, social and demographic areas and income inequality. Additional
methods to improve the models and suggestions are also provided.
